# https://www.osutools.com

### A static site attempting to maintain a list of all 3rd party resources commonly used alongside osu!

# How to add items

Please make a pull request for any additional resources that should be added to the site. I want things to stay pretty basic for this, so just make changes to the html page for now.

If you aren't git-savy, feel free to request an item in my discord server or directly to me ponpar#0001.

# What am I looking for?

Anything that isn't created by peppy, or is not available through the main osu site. Things like skins, beatmaps, or tournaments, are not intended for this list.
